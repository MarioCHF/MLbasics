# MLbasics
This repository covers some standard Machine Learning (ML) algorithms such as Categorical Naive Bayes, logistic regression (mini-batch version) and One vs Rest. The goal of the repository is to implement these algoritms and some preprocessing utils needed (for example train_test_split, One Hot encoding and Standard scaler) from scratch, using only python's numpy library. The implemented algorithms will be used to classify some datasets such as iris, breast_cancer and credits.

The repository is divided in 4 files and a folder: A utils.py file containing some functions needed to preprocess data and evaluate results; the carga_datos.py file used to load the data needed to run the examples; the models.py file, where all the ML models are implemented; and finally the examples.py file, where all the functions and models defined in the other files are tested and showed. The datos folder contains the data used in the examples.py file.
